Periods
=======

The main feature of CalendR is the time period manipulation. There is 5 Period types available for the moment :

* Year
* Month
* Week
* Day
* Range

All theese class are under the `CalendR\Period` namespace

### Retrieve a period

Excepting the range class, all the period types can be generated using the CalendR factory, wich is the simplest way.

{% highlight php %}
<?php

$factory = new CalendR\Calendar;

$year  = $factory->getYear($year);
$month = $factory->getYear($year, $month);
$week  = $factory->getYear($year, $weeknum);
$day   = $factory->getYear($year, $month, $day);

?>
{% endhighlight %}

### Iterating over a period

You can iterate other Year, Month, and Week.

Iterating over Year gives you Months
Iterating over Month gives you Weeks, but you can use the getDays() method to iterate over days
Iterating over Week gives you Days

This allows you to create a calendars in seconds :

{% highlight php %}
<?php
// Use the factory to get your period
$factory = new CalendR\Calendar;
$month = $factory->getMonth(2012, 01);
?>

<table>
    <?php // Iterate over your month and get weeks ?>
    <?php foreach ($month as $week): ?>
    <tr>
        <?php // Iterate over your month and get days ?>
        <?php foreach ($week as $day): ?>
            <?php //Check days that are out of your month ?>
            <td><?php echo $day ?></td>
        <?php endforeach ?>
    </tr>
    <?php endforeach ?>
</table>
{% endhighlight %}
